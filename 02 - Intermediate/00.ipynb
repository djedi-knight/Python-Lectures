For example, in **CPython release 3.3** the compiled version of `spam.py` would be cached as `__pycache__/spam.cpython-33.pyc`. This naming convention allows compiled modules from different releases and different versions of Python to coexist.\n",

Also, the compiled modules are platform-independent, so the same library can be shared among systems with different architectures.\n",

    "- You can use the `-O` or `-OO` switches on the Python command to reduce the size of a compiled module. The `-O` switch removes assert statements, the `-OO` switch removes both assert statements and `__doc__` strings. Since some programs may rely on having these available, you should only use this option if you know what you’re doing. **“Optimized”** modules have an `opt-` tag and are usually smaller. Future releases may change the effects of optimization.\n",
