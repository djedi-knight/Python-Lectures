    "    0.125\n",
    "\n",
    "has value 1/10 + 2/100 + 5/1000, and in the same way the binary fraction\n",
    "\n",
    "    0.001\n",
    "\n",
    "has value 0/2 + 0/4 + 1/8. These two fractions have identical values, the only real difference being that the first is written in base 10 fractional notation, and the second in base 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary fractions. A consequence is that, in general, the decimal floating-point numbers you enter are only approximated by the binary floating-point numbers actually stored in the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is easier to understand at first in base 10. Consider the fraction 1/3. You can approximate that as a base 10 fraction:\n",

    "\n",
    "and so on. No matter how many digits you’re willing to write down, the result will never be exactly 1/3, but will be an increasingly better approximation of 1/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way, no matter how many base 2 digits you’re willing to use, the decimal value 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a base 2 fraction. In base 2, 1/10 is the infinitely repeating fraction\n",

    "Stop at any finite number of bits, and you get an approximation. On most machines today, floats are approximated using a binary fraction with the numerator using the first 53 bits starting with the most significant bit and with the denominator as a power of two. In the case of 1/10, the binary fraction is `3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55` which is close to but not exactly equal to the true value of 1/10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many users are not aware of the approximation because of the way values are displayed. Python only prints a decimal approximation to the true decimal value of the binary approximation stored by the machine. On most machines, if Python were to print the true decimal value of the binary approximation stored for 0.1, it would have to display\n",

    "\n",
    "Just remember, even though the printed result looks like the exact value of 1/10, the actual stored value is the nearest representable binary fraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, there are many different decimal numbers that share the same nearest approximate binary fraction. For example, the numbers `0.1` and `0.10000000000000001` and `0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625` are all approximated by `3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55`. Since all of these decimal values share the same approximation, any one of them could be displayed while still preserving the invariant `eval(repr(x)) == x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, the Python prompt and built-in [repr()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr) function would choose the one with 17 significant digits, `0.10000000000000001`. Starting with Python 3.1, Python (on most systems) is now able to choose the shortest of these and simply display `0.1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is in the very nature of binary floating-point: this is not a bug in Python, and it is not a bug in your code either. You’ll see the same kind of thing in all languages that support your hardware’s floating-point arithmetic (although some languages may not *display* the difference by default, or in all output modes).\n",
