For example, in CPython release 3.3 the compiled version of `spam.py` would be cached as `__pycache__/spam.cpython-33.pyc`. This naming convention allows compiled modules from different releases and different versions of Python to coexist.\n",

This includes any names defined (and submodules explicitly loaded) by `__init__.py`. It also includes any submodules of the package that were explicitly loaded by previous [import](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) statements. Consider this code:\n",
