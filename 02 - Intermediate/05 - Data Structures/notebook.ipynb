    "Another useful data type built into Python is the *dictionary* (see [Mapping Types — dict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping)). Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as \"associative memories\" or \"associative arrays\". Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by *keys*, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can't use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like `append()` and `extend()`.\n",

    "It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of *key: value* pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: `{}`. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key: value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.\n",

    "The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the key. It is also possible to delete a key: value pair with `del`.
