Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as \"associative memories\" or \"associative arrays\". Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by *keys*, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can't use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like `append()` and `extend()`.\n",

Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key: value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.\n",
